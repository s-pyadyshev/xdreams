        h3 At Dreams, wellbeing isn’t something we sweep under the bed – it’s central to how we look after each other.
        h4 We want every colleague to feel supported, valued and cared for, whether that’s through a quick chat with a teammate or longer-term help when it’s needed most. Our aim? To create an environment where people can truly rest easy, knowing their wellbeing always comes first.

              h3 The four pillars of wellbeing
              h4 Our approach covers every part of life, because true rest and balance don’t come from one thing alone:
              ul 
                li <b>Financial</b> – helping you feel secure about money.
                li <b>Physical</b> – encouraging healthier lifestyles that give you more energy. 
                li <b>Emotional</b> – providing support when things feel tough. 
                li <b>Societal</b> – building stronger connections in our communities.
              p Even our benefits are built around these pillars, so you can feel confident there’s support in place whenever you need it – helping you rest easy and helping us all deliver on our bigger purpose.

              h3 Mental Health Champions
              h4 We’ve trained a network of Mental Health Champions who are always ready to listen and lend support.
              p Sometimes just having someone hear you out can lift a weight – and our managers are equipped with the tools and confidence to have open, honest conversations around mental health whenever they’re needed.

              h3 Wellbeing, every day
              h4 Wellbeing isn’t an annual initiative – it’s woven into our culture.
              p From webinars to in-person events and activities, we make sure support is easy to find and part of everyday life, not just something that happens once in a while.
